### **Normalization and Denormalization in Databases**

#### **Normalization Benefits**

1. **Reduction of Redundancy**: Organizes data to eliminate duplication, e.g., using a `Suppliers` table to avoid repeating supplier names.
2. **Improved Data Integrity**: Ensures consistent updates, avoids anomalies, and maintains referential integrity.
3. **Logical Organization**: Each table represents a single entity, simplifying management.

#### **Trade-offs of Normalization**

1. **Increased Query Complexity**: Requires joining multiple tables, potentially slowing queries.
2. **Performance Overhead**: More disk I/O and complex write operations.
3. **Scalability Challenges**: High-volume systems may struggle with frequent joins.

#### **When to Use Denormalization**

1. **Improving Read Performance**: Reduces joins by duplicating data.
2. **Optimizing for Analytics**: Efficient for large data aggregations.
3. **Reducing Query Complexity**: Simplifies and speeds up queries.
4. **Real-time Applications**: Reduces response times by avoiding complex joins.

#### **Striking the Balance**

- **Transactional Systems (OLTP)**: Prioritize normalization for consistency.
- **Analytical Systems (OLAP)**: Favor denormalization for performance.

#### **Conclusion**

Normalization ensures data integrity and reduces redundancy, while denormalization improves performance in specific scenarios. A hybrid approach often provides the best balance.
