# Database Management Systems Lab: TechCorp Case Study

## Introduction

This project demonstrates comprehensive database management and storage system implementation through a real-world case study of TechCorp. The project covers database normalization, transaction management, concurrency control, NoSQL databases, and data lake architecture.

## Project Components

### 1. Database Normalization

- Analysis of denormalized data structure
- Implementation of Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) development
- Primary and foreign key management

### 2. Transaction Management

- ACID properties implementation
- Order processing system
- Inventory management
- Transaction isolation

### 3. Concurrency Control

- Row-level locking mechanisms
- Multi-user environment handling
- Stock management system
- Conflict prevention

### 4. MongoDB Implementation

- Document store design
- Product catalog management
- Flexible schema implementation
- Multi-product type handling

### 5. Data Lake Architecture

- Analytics platform design
- Data ingestion workflows
- Storage optimization
- Processing pipeline implementation

## Technologies Used

- **Relational Database**
  - SQL
  - Transaction Management
  - Concurrency Control
- **MongoDB**
  - Document Store
  - JSON-like Documents
  - Flexible Schema
- **Data Lake Tools**
  - Storage Systems
  - Processing Frameworks
  - Analytics Platform

## Setup Instructions

### Database Setup

1. Set up relational database system
2. Create normalized tables
3. Implement transaction controls
4. Configure concurrency mechanisms

## Features

- Database normalization to 3NF
- ACID-compliant transaction management
- Concurrent transaction handling
- Flexible document store implementation
- Scalable data lake architecture

## Implementation Guide

### Transaction Management

1. Begin transaction
2. Check inventory
3. Process order
4. Update stock
5. Commit transaction

### Concurrency Control

1. Implement row-level locking
2. Handle multiple simultaneous transactions
3. Prevent data inconsistencies
4. Manage deadlock scenarios

## Best Practices

- Maintain normalized database structure
- Implement proper transaction isolation
- Use appropriate locking mechanisms
- Design flexible document schemas
- Plan scalable data lake architecture
